Or worse, you’re stuck seeing an old version of a page you know just updated.\nI’ve been there. Too many times, actually.\nBrowsers cache data to speed things up, which is great until it isn’t. Cookies track your sessions and preferences, but they also pile up like digital clutter, slowing everything down or breaking functionality entirely. The fix? Clear them out.\nBut here’s the thing: every browser hides these settings in slightly different places. Chrome buries it under three submenus. Safari splits cache and cookies into separate actions. Firefox gives you granular control but makes you hunt for it.\nI’ve spent years working in web development, and I still have to look up the exact steps sometimes. So I’m writing this down once and for all—not just for me, but for anyone who’s tired of googling “how to clear cache” for the fifth time this month.\nThis guide covers Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Brave. I’ve tested every step as of early 2025, so these instructions are current.\nWhy You Should Actually Care About Cache and Cookies Cache is your browser’s short-term memory. It stores images, scripts, and stylesheets so websites load faster on repeat visits. Sounds good, right? It is, until that memory gets corrupted or outdated.\nI once spent two hours debugging a website issue that turned out to be my own cached CSS file. The site had updated, but my browser kept serving me the old version. Cleared the cache. Problem solved in ten seconds.\nCookies are different. They’re small text files that remember your login status, shopping cart, language preferences—basically anything a website wants to recall about you. But they also track you across sites, and over time, they accumulate into a privacy nightmare.\nClearing them logs you out of everything, which is annoying. But it’s also the fastest way to fix login loops, session errors, or sites that “remember” settings you’ve already changed.\nHow to Clear Cache and Cookies on Google Chrome Chrome is the most popular browser, so let’s start here. The process is fast once you know the keyboard shortcut.\nStep 1: Open the Clear Browsing Data Menu Press Ctrl + Shift + Delete on Windows or Linux. On Mac, it’s Command + Shift + Delete.\nThis opens the “Clear browsing data” dialog directly. No menu hunting required.\n[PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing Chrome’s Clear browsing data dialog with keyboard shortcut overlay]\nStep 2: Choose Your Time Range At the top of the dialog, you’ll see a dropdown labeled “Time range.” If you want a full reset, select All time. If you’re just troubleshooting a recent issue, try “Last hour” or “Last 24 hours.”\nIn my testing, clearing the last hour is usually enough to fix loading glitches. Going nuclear with “All time” is for when things are really broken.\nStep 3: Select Cache and Cookies Make sure these two boxes are checked:\nCookies and other site data Cached images and files Leave “Browsing history” unchecked unless you want to wipe that too. I usually don’t bother.\nStep 4: Hit Clear Data Click the blue “Clear data” button. Chrome will process it in a second or two. You’ll know it worked when you’re logged out of sites and pages load slightly slower on the first visit (because the cache is gone).\n[PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot highlighting the “Clear data” button in Chrome]\nHow to Clear Cache and Cookies on Mozilla Firefox Firefox gives you more control than Chrome, but the menu structure is a bit clunkier. Here’s the fastest path.\nStep 1: Open the Clear Data Dialog Press Ctrl + Shift + Delete (Windows/Linux) or Command + Shift + Delete (Mac). Same shortcut as Chrome.\nThis opens Firefox’s “Clear All History” window.\nStep 2: Set the Time Range Under “Time range to clear,” choose Everything if you want a full wipe. Firefox also lets you pick specific time frames, which is useful if you only need to clear recent data.\nStep 3: Check Cache and Cookies Expand the “History” dropdown if it’s not already showing options. Check:\nCookies Cache Firefox also lists things like “Active Logins” and “Site Preferences.” I usually leave those unchecked unless I’m trying to fully reset a specific site’s behavior.\nStep 4: Clear Now Hit the “Clear Now” button. Firefox will flush the data immediately.\nOne thing I like about Firefox: it shows you exactly how much cache you’re clearing (in megabytes). Chrome doesn’t do that.\n[PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of Firefox’s Clear All History window with checkboxes highlighted]\nHow to Clear Cache and Cookies on Safari (macOS and iOS) Safari on Mac is straightforward. Safari on iPhone is weirdly buried in the Settings app. Let’s cover both.\nmacOS Safari Press Command + Option + E to clear the cache. That’s it. Cache gone.\nBut wait—that doesn’t clear cookies. For cookies, you have to:\nGo to Safari \u003e Preferences (or press Command + ,) Click the Privacy tab Click Manage Website Data Click Remove All [PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing Safari Privacy tab with Manage Website Data button]\nI know. It’s ridiculous that Safari splits this into two separate actions. But that’s Apple for you.\niOS Safari On your iPhone or iPad:\nOpen the Settings app Scroll down to Safari Tap Clear History and Website Data This nukes everything—history, cache, and cookies—in one shot. You can’t be selective on iOS, which is both a blessing and a curse.\nHow to Clear Cache and Cookies on Microsoft Edge Edge is basically Chrome with a Microsoft skin, so the process is nearly identical.\nStep 1: Open Clear Browsing Data Press Ctrl + Shift + Delete (Windows) or Command + Shift + Delete (Mac).\nStep 2: Choose Time Range Select All time from the dropdown if you want a full reset.\nStep 3: Select Data Types Check:\nCookies and other site data Cached images and files Edge also has a “Download history” option, which Chrome doesn’t. I usually leave that unchecked.\nStep 4: Clear Now Click “Clear now.” Edge will process it instantly.\n[PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of Edge’s Clear browsing data panel]\nEdge does one thing better than Chrome: it shows you the exact size of your cache before you clear it. Useful if you’re trying to free up disk space.\nHow to Clear Cache and Cookies on Brave Brave is privacy-focused, so it actually makes this process easier than most browsers.\nStep 1: Open Clear Browsing Data Press Ctrl + Shift + Delete (Windows/Linux) or Command + Shift + Delete (Mac).\nSame shortcut. Brave inherited this from its Chromium foundation.\nStep 2: Choose Time Range Select All time for a full wipe.\nStep 3: Select Cache and Cookies Check:\nCookies and other site data Cached images and files Brave also has an option to clear “Site and Shields Settings,” which resets your per-site privacy configurations. I only check that if I’m debugging Brave’s built-in ad blocker.\nStep 4: Clear Data Hit “Clear data.” Done.\n[PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of Brave’s Clear browsing data dialog]\nPro-Tip: Use Incognito/Private Mode to Avoid the Mess Entirely Here’s something I wish I’d internalized earlier: private browsing modes (Incognito in Chrome, Private in Safari, etc.) automatically clear cache and cookies when you close the window.\nIf you’re testing a website, debugging a login issue, or just don’t want a site to remember you, skip all the manual clearing and just pop open a private window. Everything resets automatically when you’re done.\nI use this constantly now. Regular browsing for everyday stuff. Private windows for testing or one-off logins. Saves me from clearing data manually every other day.\nTroubleshooting: When Clearing Cache Doesn’t Fix the Problem Sometimes you clear everything and the issue persists. Here are three things I check next.\nQ: The site still shows the old version. Why? Your DNS cache might be the culprit. Browsers cache data, but so does your operating system.\nOn Windows, open Command Prompt and run:\nipconfig /flushdns On Mac, it’s:\nsudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder This resets your system’s DNS memory, which can fix issues where a browser cache clear didn’t.\nQ: I’m still logged out after clearing cookies. Can I selectively clear them? Yes. Most browsers let you delete cookies for individual sites.\nIn Chrome, go to Settings \u003e Privacy and security \u003e Cookies and other site data \u003e See all site data. Search for the site, then delete just its cookies.\nFirefox has a similar option under Settings \u003e Privacy \u0026 Security \u003e Cookies and Site Data \u003e Manage Data.\nI use this when I want to reset a single site without logging out of everything else.\nQ: My browser is still slow after clearing cache. What else could it be? Extensions. I’ve seen browser performance tank because of a single poorly-coded extension.\nDisable all extensions temporarily (Chrome: chrome://extensions, Firefox: about:addons). If the browser speeds up, re-enable them one by one to find the offender.\nAlso, check how many tabs you have open. I’m guilty of running 50+ tabs, and that alone can slow things down more than cache ever could.\nFinal Thoughts Clearing cache and cookies is one of those basic maintenance tasks that everyone should know but somehow remains a mystery. I still see people reinstalling browsers or even resetting their entire OS to fix issues that would’ve taken ten seconds to solve with a cache clear.\nBookmark this guide. Share it with your less tech-savvy friends. The next time your browser acts up, you’ll know exactly what to do.\nAnd if you’re a developer like me, make this a habit after every major site update. It’ll save you from that embarrassing moment where you’re debugging phantom issues caused by your own stale cache.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>Your browser is acting weird again. Pages load halfway, then freeze. You&rsquo;re logged out of sites you never signed out of. Or worse, you&rsquo;re stuck seeing an old version of a page you know just updated.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been there. Too many times, actually.</p>
<p>Browsers cache data to speed things up, which is great until it isn&rsquo;t. Cookies track your sessions and preferences, but they also pile up like digital clutter, slowing everything down or breaking functionality entirely. The fix? Clear them out.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing: every browser hides these settings in slightly different places. Chrome buries it under three submenus. Safari splits cache and cookies into separate actions. Firefox gives you granular control but makes you hunt for it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent years working in web development, and I still have to look up the exact steps sometimes. So I&rsquo;m writing this down once and for all—not just for me, but for anyone who&rsquo;s tired of googling &ldquo;how to clear cache&rdquo; for the fifth time this month.</p>
<p>This guide covers Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Brave. I&rsquo;ve tested every step as of early 2025, so these instructions are current.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-should-actually-care-about-cache-and-cookies">Why You Should Actually Care About Cache and Cookies<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#why-you-should-actually-care-about-cache-and-cookies">#</a></h2>
<p>Cache is your browser&rsquo;s short-term memory. It stores images, scripts, and stylesheets so websites load faster on repeat visits. Sounds good, right? It is, until that memory gets corrupted or outdated.</p>
<p>I once spent two hours debugging a website issue that turned out to be my own cached CSS file. The site had updated, but my browser kept serving me the old version. Cleared the cache. Problem solved in ten seconds.</p>
<p>Cookies are different. They&rsquo;re small text files that remember your login status, shopping cart, language preferences—basically anything a website wants to recall about you. But they also track you across sites, and over time, they accumulate into a privacy nightmare.</p>
<p>Clearing them logs you out of everything, which is annoying. But it&rsquo;s also the fastest way to fix login loops, session errors, or sites that &ldquo;remember&rdquo; settings you&rsquo;ve already changed.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-clear-cache-and-cookies-on-google-chrome">How to Clear Cache and Cookies on Google Chrome<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-to-clear-cache-and-cookies-on-google-chrome">#</a></h2>
<p>Chrome is the most popular browser, so let&rsquo;s start here. The process is fast once you know the keyboard shortcut.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-open-the-clear-browsing-data-menu">Step 1: Open the Clear Browsing Data Menu<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-1-open-the-clear-browsing-data-menu">#</a></h3>
<p>Press <code>Ctrl + Shift + Delete</code> on Windows or Linux. On Mac, it&rsquo;s <code>Command + Shift + Delete</code>.</p>
<p>This opens the &ldquo;Clear browsing data&rdquo; dialog directly. No menu hunting required.</p>
<p>[PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing Chrome&rsquo;s Clear browsing data dialog with keyboard shortcut overlay]</p>
<h3 id="step-2-choose-your-time-range">Step 2: Choose Your Time Range<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-2-choose-your-time-range">#</a></h3>
<p>At the top of the dialog, you&rsquo;ll see a dropdown labeled &ldquo;Time range.&rdquo; If you want a full reset, select <strong>All time</strong>. If you&rsquo;re just troubleshooting a recent issue, try &ldquo;Last hour&rdquo; or &ldquo;Last 24 hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In my testing, clearing the last hour is usually enough to fix loading glitches. Going nuclear with &ldquo;All time&rdquo; is for when things are really broken.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-select-cache-and-cookies">Step 3: Select Cache and Cookies<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-3-select-cache-and-cookies">#</a></h3>
<p>Make sure these two boxes are checked:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cookies and other site data</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cached images and files</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Leave &ldquo;Browsing history&rdquo; unchecked unless you want to wipe that too. I usually don&rsquo;t bother.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-hit-clear-data">Step 4: Hit Clear Data<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-4-hit-clear-data">#</a></h3>
<p>Click the blue &ldquo;Clear data&rdquo; button. Chrome will process it in a second or two. You&rsquo;ll know it worked when you&rsquo;re logged out of sites and pages load slightly slower on the first visit (because the cache is gone).</p>
<p>[PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot highlighting the &ldquo;Clear data&rdquo; button in Chrome]</p>
<h2 id="how-to-clear-cache-and-cookies-on-mozilla-firefox">How to Clear Cache and Cookies on Mozilla Firefox<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-to-clear-cache-and-cookies-on-mozilla-firefox">#</a></h2>
<p>Firefox gives you more control than Chrome, but the menu structure is a bit clunkier. Here&rsquo;s the fastest path.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-open-the-clear-data-dialog">Step 1: Open the Clear Data Dialog<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-1-open-the-clear-data-dialog">#</a></h3>
<p>Press <code>Ctrl + Shift + Delete</code> (Windows/Linux) or <code>Command + Shift + Delete</code> (Mac). Same shortcut as Chrome.</p>
<p>This opens Firefox&rsquo;s &ldquo;Clear All History&rdquo; window.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-set-the-time-range">Step 2: Set the Time Range<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-2-set-the-time-range">#</a></h3>
<p>Under &ldquo;Time range to clear,&rdquo; choose <strong>Everything</strong> if you want a full wipe. Firefox also lets you pick specific time frames, which is useful if you only need to clear recent data.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-check-cache-and-cookies">Step 3: Check Cache and Cookies<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-3-check-cache-and-cookies">#</a></h3>
<p>Expand the &ldquo;History&rdquo; dropdown if it&rsquo;s not already showing options. Check:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cookies</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cache</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Firefox also lists things like &ldquo;Active Logins&rdquo; and &ldquo;Site Preferences.&rdquo; I usually leave those unchecked unless I&rsquo;m trying to fully reset a specific site&rsquo;s behavior.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-clear-now">Step 4: Clear Now<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-4-clear-now">#</a></h3>
<p>Hit the &ldquo;Clear Now&rdquo; button. Firefox will flush the data immediately.</p>
<p>One thing I like about Firefox: it shows you exactly how much cache you&rsquo;re clearing (in megabytes). Chrome doesn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>[PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of Firefox&rsquo;s Clear All History window with checkboxes highlighted]</p>
<h2 id="how-to-clear-cache-and-cookies-on-safari-macos-and-ios">How to Clear Cache and Cookies on Safari (macOS and iOS)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-to-clear-cache-and-cookies-on-safari-macos-and-ios">#</a></h2>
<p>Safari on Mac is straightforward. Safari on iPhone is weirdly buried in the Settings app. Let&rsquo;s cover both.</p>
<h3 id="macos-safari">macOS Safari<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#macos-safari">#</a></h3>
<p>Press <code>Command + Option + E</code> to clear the cache. That&rsquo;s it. Cache gone.</p>
<p>But wait—that doesn&rsquo;t clear cookies. For cookies, you have to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Safari &gt; Preferences</strong> (or press <code>Command + ,</code>)</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Privacy</strong> tab</li>
<li>Click <strong>Manage Website Data</strong></li>
<li>Click <strong>Remove All</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>[PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing Safari Privacy tab with Manage Website Data button]</p>
<p>I know. It&rsquo;s ridiculous that Safari splits this into two separate actions. But that&rsquo;s Apple for you.</p>
<h3 id="ios-safari">iOS Safari<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#ios-safari">#</a></h3>
<p>On your iPhone or iPad:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app</li>
<li>Scroll down to <strong>Safari</strong></li>
<li>Tap <strong>Clear History and Website Data</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This nukes everything—history, cache, and cookies—in one shot. You can&rsquo;t be selective on iOS, which is both a blessing and a curse.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-clear-cache-and-cookies-on-microsoft-edge">How to Clear Cache and Cookies on Microsoft Edge<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-to-clear-cache-and-cookies-on-microsoft-edge">#</a></h2>
<p>Edge is basically Chrome with a Microsoft skin, so the process is nearly identical.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-open-clear-browsing-data">Step 1: Open Clear Browsing Data<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-1-open-clear-browsing-data">#</a></h3>
<p>Press <code>Ctrl + Shift + Delete</code> (Windows) or <code>Command + Shift + Delete</code> (Mac).</p>
<h3 id="step-2-choose-time-range">Step 2: Choose Time Range<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-2-choose-time-range">#</a></h3>
<p>Select <strong>All time</strong> from the dropdown if you want a full reset.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-select-data-types">Step 3: Select Data Types<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-3-select-data-types">#</a></h3>
<p>Check:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cookies and other site data</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cached images and files</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Edge also has a &ldquo;Download history&rdquo; option, which Chrome doesn&rsquo;t. I usually leave that unchecked.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-clear-now-1">Step 4: Clear Now<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-4-clear-now-1">#</a></h3>
<p>Click &ldquo;Clear now.&rdquo; Edge will process it instantly.</p>
<p>[PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of Edge&rsquo;s Clear browsing data panel]</p>
<p>Edge does one thing better than Chrome: it shows you the exact size of your cache before you clear it. Useful if you&rsquo;re trying to free up disk space.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-clear-cache-and-cookies-on-brave">How to Clear Cache and Cookies on Brave<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-to-clear-cache-and-cookies-on-brave">#</a></h2>
<p>Brave is privacy-focused, so it actually makes this process easier than most browsers.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-open-clear-browsing-data-1">Step 1: Open Clear Browsing Data<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-1-open-clear-browsing-data-1">#</a></h3>
<p>Press <code>Ctrl + Shift + Delete</code> (Windows/Linux) or <code>Command + Shift + Delete</code> (Mac).</p>
<p>Same shortcut. Brave inherited this from its Chromium foundation.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-choose-time-range-1">Step 2: Choose Time Range<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-2-choose-time-range-1">#</a></h3>
<p>Select <strong>All time</strong> for a full wipe.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-select-cache-and-cookies-1">Step 3: Select Cache and Cookies<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-3-select-cache-and-cookies-1">#</a></h3>
<p>Check:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cookies and other site data</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cached images and files</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Brave also has an option to clear &ldquo;Site and Shields Settings,&rdquo; which resets your per-site privacy configurations. I only check that if I&rsquo;m debugging Brave&rsquo;s built-in ad blocker.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-clear-data">Step 4: Clear Data<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-4-clear-data">#</a></h3>
<p>Hit &ldquo;Clear data.&rdquo; Done.</p>
<p>[PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of Brave&rsquo;s Clear browsing data dialog]</p>
<h2 id="pro-tip-use-incognitoprivate-mode-to-avoid-the-mess-entirely">Pro-Tip: Use Incognito/Private Mode to Avoid the Mess Entirely<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#pro-tip-use-incognitoprivate-mode-to-avoid-the-mess-entirely">#</a></h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s something I wish I&rsquo;d internalized earlier: private browsing modes (Incognito in Chrome, Private in Safari, etc.) automatically clear cache and cookies when you close the window.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re testing a website, debugging a login issue, or just don&rsquo;t want a site to remember you, skip all the manual clearing and just pop open a private window. Everything resets automatically when you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>I use this constantly now. Regular browsing for everyday stuff. Private windows for testing or one-off logins. Saves me from clearing data manually every other day.</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting-when-clearing-cache-doesnt-fix-the-problem">Troubleshooting: When Clearing Cache Doesn&rsquo;t Fix the Problem<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#troubleshooting-when-clearing-cache-doesnt-fix-the-problem">#</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes you clear everything and the issue persists. Here are three things I check next.</p>
<h3 id="q-the-site-still-shows-the-old-version-why">Q: The site still shows the old version. Why?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#q-the-site-still-shows-the-old-version-why">#</a></h3>
<p>Your DNS cache might be the culprit. Browsers cache data, but so does your operating system.</p>
<p>On Windows, open Command Prompt and run:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>ipconfig /flushdns
</code></pre><p>On Mac, it&rsquo;s:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
</code></pre><p>This resets your system&rsquo;s DNS memory, which can fix issues where a browser cache clear didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<h3 id="q-im-still-logged-out-after-clearing-cookies-can-i-selectively-clear-them">Q: I&rsquo;m still logged out after clearing cookies. Can I selectively clear them?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#q-im-still-logged-out-after-clearing-cookies-can-i-selectively-clear-them">#</a></h3>
<p>Yes. Most browsers let you delete cookies for individual sites.</p>
<p>In Chrome, go to <strong>Settings &gt; Privacy and security &gt; Cookies and other site data &gt; See all site data</strong>. Search for the site, then delete just its cookies.</p>
<p>Firefox has a similar option under <strong>Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Cookies and Site Data &gt; Manage Data</strong>.</p>
<p>I use this when I want to reset a single site without logging out of everything else.</p>
<h3 id="q-my-browser-is-still-slow-after-clearing-cache-what-else-could-it-be">Q: My browser is still slow after clearing cache. What else could it be?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#q-my-browser-is-still-slow-after-clearing-cache-what-else-could-it-be">#</a></h3>
<p>Extensions. I&rsquo;ve seen browser performance tank because of a single poorly-coded extension.</p>
<p>Disable all extensions temporarily (Chrome: <code>chrome://extensions</code>, Firefox: <code>about:addons</code>). If the browser speeds up, re-enable them one by one to find the offender.</p>
<p>Also, check how many tabs you have open. I&rsquo;m guilty of running 50+ tabs, and that alone can slow things down more than cache ever could.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#final-thoughts">#</a></h2>
<p>Clearing cache and cookies is one of those basic maintenance tasks that everyone should know but somehow remains a mystery. I still see people reinstalling browsers or even resetting their entire OS to fix issues that would&rsquo;ve taken ten seconds to solve with a cache clear.</p>
<p>Bookmark this guide. Share it with your less tech-savvy friends. The next time your browser acts up, you&rsquo;ll know exactly what to do.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re a developer like me, make this a habit after every major site update. It&rsquo;ll save you from that embarrassing moment where you&rsquo;re debugging phantom issues caused by your own stale cache.</p>
